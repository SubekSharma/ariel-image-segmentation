## Introduction

Aerial image segmentation is a crucial task in various applications such as urban planning, agriculture, and disaster management. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to segment aerial images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in the `Road_seg_dataset` repository. It includes aerial images and their corresponding segmentation masks. You can clone the dataset using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parth1620/Road_seg_dataset.git
```

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SubekSharma/ariel-image-segmentation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ariel-image-segmentation
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Clone the dataset repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/parth1620/Road_seg_dataset.git
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Aerial_Image_Segmentation_with_PyTorch.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The notebook includes various visualizations to show the segmentation results. Below are some sample outputs from the model:
